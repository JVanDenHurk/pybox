        "text": "Below interactions, there are 3 Entity effects that this Entity performs in the Dreamscape Phase: Morphing , Basic , and Special , in addition to its Movement .\n\nMorphing Basic Special As you can see, they correspond to Steps on the Turn cards .\n\nWhen Dreamers finish their actions in each Turn , the Dreamscape Phase takes effect.\n\nYou do this by resolving the current Turn card (the face up card on the top of your Turn deck).\n\nResolve all Steps from the current Turn card in order.\n\nSteps may trigger some of the Entity's effects.\n\nFor example, the first Turn may be: Movement > Special effect > Morphing effect , and the second one may be: Basic effect > Basic effect again> Movement .\n\nEach Turn is different from the others.\n\nThis Entity has no Morphing effects available (as it would make it too powerful for you now otherwise).\n\nIf a specific Entity doesn't have some of the effects, treat them as if they do nothing when they should be resolved.\n\nMorphings are basically power ups that make Entities a lot meaner and more difficult to deal with.\n\nWhen an effect tells you to \" add 1 (or more) morphings \" you will draw randomly from the Morphing Token pile and place them face up on the Entity.\n\nFrom then on, as long as the Entity has the token, it will apply its effects.\n\nSee ENTITY: MORPHINGS - s.248.1 for more information.\n\nThe Basic effect is the effect that is triggered the most often.\n\nThe Basic effect will generally harm nearby Dreamers.\n\nIn this case, if any Dreamer is in range 1 ( in the same or in an adjacent space ) when resolving the Basic effect of this Entity, this Dreamer suffers 1 damage .\n\nIf you don't remember how damage works, consult: Dying - s.450.2 .\n\nIn short - if any Dreamer suffers their 8th damage , they die.\n\nAnd usually this isn't pleasant.\n\nThe Special effect of this Entity has an even greater range of 2 .\n\nRemember that range may be counted in any direction orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but not diagonally .\n\nA space connected diagonally is in range 2 - 1 space vertically and 1 horizontally.\n\nIn this case, the Special effect Seals 2 cards .\n\nFor a reminder of how sealing works go to - s.450.2 .\n\nIt's a good habit to always look at the Turn card and check what the Entity will do when you end your Dreamers Phase .\n\nIf it doesn't look good, keep a safe distance or attack to temporarily repel the monster.\n\nSometimes your Dreamers will have other tricks up their sleeves in order to manipulate this card.\n\nFor example, one of your influence cards ( \"Thoughtful Moment\" ) allows you to \"Seal it in order to block any 1 Step on the current Turn card\" .\n\nWhen you do this you can use a marker to \"block\" a certain effect from happening.\n\nThis can sometimes get you out of tight spots!

Deep down we have the sinking feeling that something has gone wrong ...\n\ncatastrophically wrong.\n\nVague memories linger as if we were waking from a deep slumber.\n\nEach moment they elusively slip through our fingers like grains of sand until eventually there is nothing left but emptiness.\n\nWe hear song birds.\n\nWe smell wet earth after the rain.\n\nPetrichor \u2013 we recall the curious name of this scent.\n\nWe wander through a maze of forest paths, each too similar to the last for a very long time; our constant companions - dirty torn clothes, burning muscles, a consuming hunger.\n\nMemories of being pursued rise from the depths of our thoughts - before we had barely escaped capture and the fear gnaws at the edge of our minds.\n\nFog rises from the steaming earth.\n\nThe golden rays of the setting sun shine behind the trees.\n\nBeautiful ...\n\nif it were not for the creeping darkness and the thing hunting us.\n\nWe must hurry.\n\nFinally, we reach a lea in front of a rock wall with massive gates.\n\nThe imposing gates are locked.\n\nThere are three locks, each with a symbol identical to that on one of the pedestals next to it \u2013 a leaf, a padlock, a wave.\n\nA small tree grows on the first pedestal, a large rusty padlock is attached to the second one, and on the third is a stone ewer from which water flows endlessly.\n\nUnconsciously we know that our escape lies through the gate.\n\nNow to open it...\n\nThis is the beginning of the tutorial segment.\n\nThere may seem like there are a lot of rules up ahead (and there are!) but we'll attempt to walk you slowly through it.\n\nLet's practice the basics then.\n\nThis is the start of a Dream and you're looking down at a bird's eye view map of the area around you.\n\nEach MAP TILE consists of four spaces .\n\nMap Tile Place your Dreamer miniatures in start (Dreamer's Entrance) spaces.\n\nAs the start symbol straddles two spaces, you may choose either of them .\n\nA space can contain at most 4 figures - these are combinations of Dreamer miniatures and/or other miniatures.\n\nA TURN will consist of a DREAMERS PHASE where all Dreamers will draw up to 4 INFLUENCE CARDS from their Influence Deck to their maximum hand size which is typically 6 , followed by a DREAMSCAPE PHASE (more on that later).\n\nSo for example, if you had 3 cards in your hand already at the beginning of the Dreamers Phase you would only draw 3 cards, which brings you to your hand size of 6 cards.\n\nSimilarly if you had 4 cards, you would only draw 2 cards.\n\nBefore you draw you may discard any number of cards.\n\nHowever you have no cards in your hand at the moment so DRAW 4 INFLUENCE CARDS NOW.\n\nNow let's look around the map.\n\nYou see 3 pedestals dotted around the Dreamscape tile you're on and on each one you will practice different actions that make up most of the different types of map actions that may appear throughout the game.\n\nOh but we forgot one thing haven't we? How do you get to these spaces first? If you look at your hand of cards now you'll notice on the top left they will have a bunch of symbols, namely yellow , red , green .\n\nThese represent your Dreamer's inner resources or INTENT to deal with problems: yellow is your CUNNING and is mainly related to movement, avoidance, cleverness and deception.\n\ngreen is your AWARENESS and is mainly related to diplomacy, conversation, observation, understanding and aptitude with technology.\n\nred is your WRATH and is mainly related to physical actions, fighting, tenacity and argument.\n\nMovement Now to move you will need to discard influence cards with yellow intent on them - one intent for each space of movement.\n\nSo if you wanted to move your Dreamer 3 spaces you could discard one influence card with 2 yellow intent and another one with 1 yellow intent.\n\nThese cards go to a personal discard pile (you can keep these face up on the right side of your Dreamer Board) and you get to move your Dreamer miniature to the intended space.\n\nRemember that you cannot normally move diagonally .\n\nIf you decide to move less than the number of intent you spent - this is possible also, but any excess intent is lost.\n\nIn fact with any of your actions, if you overspend, any excess influence is lost.\n\nNow back to the MAP ACTIONS...\n\nGreen action The green one is a simple action with a cost of 6 green .\n\nTo pay for this you will need to be on this space and then discard Influence cards from your hand for Intent - specifically cards with green icons in their top left.\n\nSo I might discard 2 cards with 2 green each (for a total of 4) and 2 more cards with green each (for a total of 2) to make up this cost.\n\nThis all has to be paid in the one action by only one Dreamer .\n\nYou may find that you need to keep cards from turn to turn in order to have enough intent to pay for this.\n\nOnce the cost has been paid, you read the relevant entry in the Secret Script.\n\nYellow action The yellow one is an action for 3 yellow but you have to pay it as many times as the number of Dreamers (that's what player-x means) in gradual increments .\n\nWe call these gradual actions and they are only resolved once the full cost has been met.\n\nAs before you also need to be on this space to pay the costs.\n\nSo for example if there are 2 Dreamers playing, the total cost of activating the space is 2 player x 3 yellow = 6 yellow intent.\n\nThis can be paid all at once in a single action OR progressively over multiple TURNS in increments of 3 yellow intent, with each payment tracked by a yellow-marker (Yellow marker) placed on the space of the action.\n\nTo illustrate this, on one turn, the Free Spirit might pay 3 yellow intent first to contribute to this (by discarding 3 yellow intent worth of cards from her hand).\n\nYou place a yellow-marker on the space to represent this.\n\nThen on another turn, the Tough Guy , can contribute another 3 yellow to complete the action, reading from the relevant script.\n\nAlternatively if you just had 6 yellow intent you could pay it outright and complete the action.\n\nRed action The red one is an Assault action with a cost of 6 red (representing wrath thematically).\n\nThis special type of action can be performed at a range of 1 (the space itself or an adjacent space but not diagonally ).\n\nOne action which hasn't been featured on this map is the Contact action which is very similar to the Assault action but uses green intent instead and also has an action range of 1 .\n\nSome of your card abilities will only work with Assault or Contact actions.\n\nSometimes you might run into actions with \"red\" or \"green\" words but if they do not mention specifically Assault or Contact they are not these actions.\n\nAdditionally, the actions on the yellow and red pedestals have a block icon, which means that they are one-use only \u2013 when performed, place a block token on them to mark that they are no longer available.\n\nGem action There is another action in the lower-left corner of the A2 tile .\n\nThis one allows you to gain 1 gem (shining blue gem) for 1 green intent.\n\nThe only limit to how many times you may perform it is the number of gem available ( 6 ) \u2013 treat yourself to all the gem if you like but this might mean that other Dreamers don't have access to them (if you're playing with others).\n\nWhat are gem used for? You may use them to reroll any die .\n\nWhy might you want to roll the di(c)e in the first place? See - s.450.3 - BOOSTING INTENT.\n\nFree action In the lower-right corner, there is a free action (with a cost of zero ) \u2013 you only have to be in this space to use it.\n\nThere is also a wall close-by - this is an impassable barrier that you can't move through or measure range through.\n\nwall You'll also note that some of your cards have abilities on the bottom of them that can be used to pay for Intent.\n\nThese abilities typically allow you to obtain Intent more efficiently.\n\nTo read more about how to use card abilities, go to - s.450.1 .\n\nNote that there is no set action structure, so feel to take your actions simultaneously to save time - that is, if you're playing with multiple players.\n\nWhen you've run out of things to do (or cards in your hands), all Dreamers will pass and you'll move into the DREAMSCAPE PHASE - go to - s.450.4 .\n\nAs this script is a condensed summary of all the rules of the games\uff08with quick links below), we recommend that you write this number (450) down somewhere in case you need to reference it again during play.\n\nWe may make a glossary of rules soon, maybe?
