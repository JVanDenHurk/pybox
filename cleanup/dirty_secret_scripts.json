You do this by resolving the current\n  <strong>\n   Turn card\n  </strong>\n  (the face up card on the top of your Turn deck). Resolve all Steps from the current Turn card in order. Steps may trigger some of the Entity's effects. For example, the first Turn may be:\n  <strong>\n   Movement\n  </strong>\n  &gt;\n  <strong>\n   Special effect\n  </strong>\n  &gt;\n  <strong>\n   Morphing effect\n  </strong>\n  , and the second one may be:\n  <strong>\n   Basic effect\n  </strong>\n  &gt;\n  <strong>\n   Basic effect\n  </strong>\n  again&gt;\n  <strong>\n   Movement\n  </strong>\n  . Each Turn is different from the others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This Entity has no\n  <strong>\n   Morphing\n  </strong>\n  effects available (as it would make it too powerful for you now otherwise). If a specific Entity doesn't have some of the effects, treat them as if they do\n  <em>\n   nothing\n  </em>\n  when they should be resolved.\n  <strong>\n   Morphings\n  </strong>\n  are basically\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    power ups\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  that make Entities a lot meaner and more difficult to deal with. When an effect tells you to \"\n  <strong>\n   add 1 (or more) morphings\n  </strong>\n  \" you will draw randomly from the Morphing Token pile and place them face up on the Entity. From then on, as long as the Entity has the token, it will apply its effects. See\n  <strong>\n   ENTITY: MORPHINGS\n  </strong>\n  -\n  <a href=\"/core/248.1\">\n   s.248.1\n  </a>\n  for more information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <strong>\n   Basic effect\n  </strong>\n  is the effect that is triggered the most often. The Basic effect will generally harm nearby Dreamers. In this case, if any Dreamer is in\n  <strong>\n   range 1\n  </strong>\n  (\n  <em>\n   in the same or in an adjacent space\n  </em>\n  ) when resolving the\n  <strong>\n   Basic effect\n  </strong>\n  of this Entity, this Dreamer suffers\n  <strong>\n   1\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"damage\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/damage.png\" title=\"Distress marker\"/>\n  . If you don't remember how\n  <img alt=\"damage\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/damage.png\" title=\"Distress marker\"/>\n  works, consult:\n  <strong>\n   Dying\n  </strong>\n  -\n  <a href=\"/core/450.2\">\n   s.450.2\n  </a>\n  . In short - if any Dreamer suffers their\n  <strong>\n   8th\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"damage\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/damage.png\" title=\"Distress marker\"/>\n  , they die. And usually this isn't pleasant.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The\n  <strong>\n   Special effect\n  </strong>\n  of this Entity has an even\n  <em>\n   greater range\n  </em>\n  of\n  <strong>\n   2\n  </strong>\n  . Remember that range may be counted in any direction\n  <strong>\n   orthogonally\n  </strong>\n  (up, down, left, right), but\n  <strong>\n   not diagonally\n  </strong>\n  . A space connected diagonally is in range\n  <strong>\n   2\n  </strong>\n  - 1 space vertically and 1 horizontally. In this case, the Special effect\n  <strong>\n   Seals 2 cards\n  </strong>\n  . For a reminder of how sealing works go to  -\n  <a href=\"/core/450.2\">\n   s.450.2\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  It's a good habit to always look at the\n  <strong>\n   Turn card\n  </strong>\n  and check what the Entity will do when you end your\n  <strong>\n   Dreamers Phase\n  </strong>\n  . If it doesn't look good, keep a safe distance or attack to temporarily repel the monster.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Sometimes your Dreamers will have other tricks up their sleeves in order to manipulate this card. For example, one of your influence cards (\n  <strong>\n   \"Thoughtful Moment\"\n  </strong>\n  ) allows you to\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \"Seal it in order to block any 1 Step on the current Turn card\"\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  . When you do this you can use a\n  <img alt=\"marker\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/marker.png\" title=\"Universal marker\"/>\n  to \"block\" a certain effect from happening. This can sometimes get you out of tight spots!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Thoughtful\" src=\"/assets/images/secrets/thoughtful.jpg\" title=\"Thoughtful Moment\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  You've opened a door and revealed 2 tiles - and so many things have changed!

Each moment they elusively slip through our fingers like grains of sand until eventually there is nothing left but emptiness.\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   We hear song birds. We smell wet earth after the rain. Petrichor \u2013 we recall the curious name of this scent.

A small tree grows on the first pedestal, a large rusty padlock is attached to the second one, and on the third is a stone ewer from which water flows endlessly. Unconsciously we know that our escape lies through the gate. Now to open it...\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   This is the beginning of the tutorial segment.\n  </strong>\n  There may seem like there are a lot of rules up ahead (and there are!) but we'll attempt to walk you slowly through it. Let's practice the basics then.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is the start of a Dream and you're looking down at a bird's eye view map of the area around you. Each\n  <strong>\n   MAP TILE\n  </strong>\n  consists of four\n  <strong>\n   spaces\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Map Tile\" src=\"/assets/images/secrets/en/secret-tile.jpg\" title=\"Map Tile\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Place your Dreamer miniatures in\n  <img alt=\"start\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/start.png\" title=\"Dreamers entrance\"/>\n  <strong>\n   (Dreamer's Entrance)\n  </strong>\n  spaces. As the\n  <img alt=\"start\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/start.png\" title=\"Dreamers entrance\"/>\n  symbol straddles two spaces, you may choose\n  <em>\n   either of them\n  </em>\n  . A space can contain at\n  <strong>\n   most 4 figures\n  </strong>\n  - these are combinations of Dreamer miniatures and/or other miniatures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A\n  <strong>\n   TURN\n  </strong>\n  will consist of a\n  <strong>\n   DREAMERS PHASE\n  </strong>\n  where all Dreamers will draw up to\n  <strong>\n   4 INFLUENCE CARDS\n  </strong>\n  from their\n  <strong>\n   Influence Deck\n  </strong>\n  to their\n  <em>\n   maximum hand size\n  </em>\n  which is typically\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    6\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  , followed by a\n  <strong>\n   DREAMSCAPE PHASE\n  </strong>\n  (more on that later). So for example, if you had 3 cards in your hand already at the beginning of the Dreamers Phase you would only draw 3 cards, which brings you to your hand size of 6 cards. Similarly if you had 4 cards, you would only draw 2 cards.\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Before you draw you may discard any number of cards.\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  However you have\n  <em>\n   no cards in your hand\n  </em>\n  at the moment so\n  <strong>\n   DRAW 4 INFLUENCE CARDS NOW.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now let's look around the map.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You see\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    3 pedestals\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  dotted around the Dreamscape tile you're on and on each one you will practice different actions that make up most of the\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    different types of map actions\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  that may appear throughout the game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Oh but we forgot one thing haven't we?\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <strong>\n   How do you get to these spaces first?\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you look at your hand of cards now you'll notice on the top left they will have a bunch of symbols, namely\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  ,\n  <img alt=\"red\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/red.png\" title=\"Wrath\"/>\n  ,\n  <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n  . These represent your Dreamer's inner resources or\n  <strong>\n   INTENT\n  </strong>\n  to deal with problems:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n   is your\n   <strong>\n    CUNNING\n   </strong>\n   and is mainly related to movement, avoidance, cleverness and deception.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n   is your\n   <strong>\n    AWARENESS\n   </strong>\n   and is mainly related to diplomacy, conversation, observation, understanding and aptitude with technology.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <img alt=\"red\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/red.png\" title=\"Wrath\"/>\n   is your\n   <strong>\n    WRATH\n   </strong>\n   and is mainly related to physical actions, fighting, tenacity and argument.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Movement\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now to\n  <strong>\n   move\n  </strong>\n  you will need to discard influence cards with\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  <strong>\n   intent\n  </strong>\n  on them - one\n  <strong>\n   intent\n  </strong>\n  for each space of movement. So if you wanted to move your Dreamer\n  <strong>\n   3\n  </strong>\n  spaces you could discard one influence card with\n  <strong>\n   2\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent and another one with\n  <strong>\n   1\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent. These cards go to a\n  <strong>\n   personal discard pile\n  </strong>\n  (you can keep these face up on the right side of your Dreamer Board) and you get to move your Dreamer miniature to the intended space. Remember that\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    you cannot normally move diagonally\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  . If you decide to move\n  <em>\n   less than\n  </em>\n  the number of intent you spent - this is possible also, but any excess intent is lost. In fact with\n  <strong>\n   any\n  </strong>\n  of your actions, if you overspend, any excess influence is lost.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Now back to the MAP ACTIONS...\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Green action\" src=\"/assets/images/secrets/green-action.png\" title=\"Green action\"/>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The\n   <strong>\n    green\n   </strong>\n   one is a simple action with a cost of\n   <strong>\n    6\n   </strong>\n   <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n   . To pay for this you will\n   <strong>\n    need to be on this space\n   </strong>\n   and then discard Influence cards from your hand for\n   <strong>\n    Intent\n   </strong>\n   - specifically cards with\n   <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n   icons in their top left. So I might discard 2 cards with 2\n   <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n   each (for a total of 4) and 2 more cards with\n   <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n   each (for a total of 2) to make up this cost. This all has to be paid in the\n   <strong>\n    one action\n   </strong>\n   by\n   <strong>\n    only one Dreamer\n   </strong>\n   . You may find that you need to keep cards from turn to turn in order to have enough intent to pay for this. Once the cost has been paid, you read the relevant entry in the Secret Script.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Yellow action\" src=\"/assets/images/secrets/yellow-action.png\" title=\"Yellow action\"/>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The\n   <strong>\n    yellow\n   </strong>\n   one is an action for\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n   <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     but\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   you have to pay it as many times as the number of Dreamers (that's what\n   <img alt=\"player-x\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/player-x.png\" title=\"Number of dreamers\"/>\n   means) in\n   <em>\n    gradual increments\n   </em>\n   . We call these\n   <strong>\n    gradual actions\n   </strong>\n   and they are only resolved once the full cost has been met. As before you also need to be on this space to pay the costs.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  So for example if there are\n  <strong>\n   2\n  </strong>\n  Dreamers playing, the total cost of activating the space is\n  <strong>\n   2\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"player\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/player.png\" title=\"Dreamer\"/>\n  x\n  <strong>\n   3\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  =\n  <strong>\n   6\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent. This can be paid all at once in a\n  <em>\n   single action\n  </em>\n  <strong>\n   OR\n  </strong>\n  progressively over multiple\n  <strong>\n   TURNS\n  </strong>\n  in increments of 3\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent, with each payment tracked by a\n  <img alt=\"yellow-marker\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow-marker.png\" title=\"Cunning marker\"/>\n  <strong>\n   (Yellow marker)\n  </strong>\n  placed on the space of the action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To illustrate this, on one turn,\n  <em>\n   the Free Spirit\n  </em>\n  might pay\n  <strong>\n   3\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent first to contribute to this (by discarding 3\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent worth of cards from her hand). You place a\n  <img alt=\"yellow-marker\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow-marker.png\" title=\"Cunning marker\"/>\n  on the space to represent this. Then on another turn,\n  <em>\n   the Tough Guy\n  </em>\n  , can contribute another 3\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  to complete the action, reading from the relevant script. Alternatively if you just had 6\n  <img alt=\"yellow\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/yellow.png\" title=\"Cunning\"/>\n  intent you could pay it outright and complete the action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Red action\" src=\"/assets/images/secrets/red-action.png\" title=\"Red action\"/>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The\n   <strong>\n    red\n   </strong>\n   one is an\n   <strong>\n    Assault action\n   </strong>\n   with a cost of 6\n   <img alt=\"red\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/red.png\" title=\"Wrath\"/>\n   (representing\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     wrath\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   thematically). This special type of action can be performed at a\n   <strong>\n    range of 1\n   </strong>\n   (the space itself or an adjacent space but\n   <em>\n    not diagonally\n   </em>\n   ). One action which hasn't been featured on this map is the\n   <strong>\n    Contact action\n   </strong>\n   which is very similar to the\n   <strong>\n    Assault action\n   </strong>\n   but uses\n   <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n   intent instead and also has an\n   <strong>\n    action range of 1\n   </strong>\n   . Some of your card abilities will only work with\n   <strong>\n    Assault\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    Contact\n   </strong>\n   actions. Sometimes you might run into actions with \"red\" or \"green\" words but if they do not mention specifically\n   <strong>\n    Assault or Contact\n   </strong>\n   they are not these actions.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Additionally, the actions on the\n  <strong>\n   yellow and red pedestals\n  </strong>\n  have a\n  <img alt=\"block\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/block.png\" title=\"Block token\"/>\n  icon, which means that they are\n  <strong>\n   one-use only\n  </strong>\n  \u2013 when performed, place a\n  <img alt=\"block\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/block.png\" title=\"Block token\"/>\n  token on them to mark that they are no longer available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Gem action\" src=\"/assets/images/secrets/gem-action.png\" title=\"Gem action\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is another action in the lower-left corner of the\n  <strong>\n   A2 tile\n  </strong>\n  . This one allows you to gain\n  <strong>\n   1\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"gem\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/gem.png\" title=\"Shining gem\"/>\n  <strong>\n   (shining blue gem)\n  </strong>\n  for\n  <strong>\n   1\n  </strong>\n  <img alt=\"green\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/green.png\" title=\"Awareness\"/>\n  intent. The only limit to how many times you may perform it is the number of\n  <img alt=\"gem\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/gem.png\" title=\"Shining gem\"/>\n  available (\n  <strong>\n   6\n  </strong>\n  ) \u2013 treat yourself to all the\n  <img alt=\"gem\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/gem.png\" title=\"Shining gem\"/>\n  if you like but this might mean that other Dreamers don't have access to them (if you're playing with others). What are\n  <img alt=\"gem\" class=\"icon\" src=\"/assets/icons/gem.png\" title=\"Shining gem\"/>\n  used for? You may use them to\n  <strong>\n   reroll any die\n  </strong>\n  .
